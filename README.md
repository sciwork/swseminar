This repository serves as a placeholder for the sciwork seminar portal.
The primary content for each yearâ€™s seminar is now hosted in dedicated
repositories, following the swseminar[year] naming convention (e.g. swseminar2025).

If a new seminar site is created, update the `netlify.toml` file in this
repository to reflect the necessary changes.
